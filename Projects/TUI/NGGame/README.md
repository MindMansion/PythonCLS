        Welcome kelvin, my name is Magic 
        Roller, in this game I will be giving you
        a chance to guess the number i'm thinking.
        
        Rules: 
        --------------------------------------------
            -> You will have 10 tries each roll. 
            -> you guess wrong you will get a 10% 
               point deduction from your total point.
            -> When you guess it right you will get 
               your total point multiplied my 10% of it, 
               added to your current point.
